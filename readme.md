## Arcade

 Did you enjoy Pacman  ? :ghost: <br />
 Did you own a Nokia mobile phone ? :iphone: <br />
 Did you ever tic tac toe's with friends :negative_squared_cross_mark: <br />
 Do you know the first successful arcade video game ? :video_game:


That was the start of our project. <br />

Using Javascript and summarising the knowledge we have so far,<br /> our End With A Bang project is about ... You guessed it ... Arcade games ! 
<br /><br />
### Style 

For the color, we wanted to stay sober or let's say minimalists

A slightly yellowish white <br />
and an eggplant purple as black
<br /><br /><br />

We used the simple [Open Sans Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)

and the rest were up to our own preferences
